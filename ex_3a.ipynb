    "In the numerical solution, we see the initial condition patently evolving into something that looks like a discontinuity. We understand that this discontinuity is formed because the characteristic curves $dx_p/dt = a(x, t, u) = u$ are more inclined (i.e., faster) in a spacetime diagram when starting at elements with larger $u$: since the solution is constant along those curves, the faster elements, therefore, catch those in front of them which have lower $u$ (as is the case in the solution you have found numerically here) – so the solution must steepen when that happens.\n",

Numerically, though, we ought to be rather surprised for various reasons:\n",

    "a. the numerical calculation of a very large value of the derivative (as is surely the case across the big jump forming in our calculation) cannot be very accurate. It might even happen, we think, that the program crashed because of _NaNs_ or exceptions, etc, occurring in the calculation. But, in fact, our program happily calculates away ... seemingly forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. when a discontinuity forms, the exact mathematical solution, strictly speaking, cannot be calculated in a simple way anymore: when there is a discontinuity, one must take into account what is called the jump relations, also called internal boundary conditions, across the discontinuity: they give the mutual relation of the variables on either side of the discontinuity. A solution obtained in this way is called a __weak solution__ in mathematics.\n",
