    "In this exercise I've gradually developed the function `analyse_instability`. The result is a quite messy function, but hopefully it's purpose is understandable. It more or less computes the solution I want given a set of input for the function and it's derivative, the numerical scheme and boundary conditions. After evolving the solutions, instead of manually inspecting the animation for instability, I perform a check of the maximum absolute value and compare it to a specified critical value also given as input. The appropriate input for this critical value is of course dependent on the problem. For the first part of the exercise I've chosen `crit_value=1.5` which corresponds to the function-value being increased by a factor of $1.5$ of it's exact value."

    "For the centered difference scheme I find no configuration of parameters resulting in a stable solution. I think this is due to the time derivative and spacial derivative being evaluated at different grid points. So for the centered differencing we have to adopt another approximation for the time derivative. The result with the present scheme looks somewhat like the unstable solutions we had previously from using the non-centered schemes in the wrong direction. The propagating function develops an oscillating tail behind it self in the direction of motion, where the solution should be equal to zero. By increasing the number of grid points to 1028, we again get this \"fuzzy\" solution which is magnified exponentially."

    "For the first case with $A=1$, we see how the initial condition evolves in time by traversing in positiv direction (as the advection speed is positiv). The points on either side of the step function moving slower than the points inside the step function. As such the points that initially started with high velocity will eventually reach a boundary between points with high and low velocity and a discontinuity develops. This discontinuity travels as a shock wave, eventually forming a triangular shape with peak at the edge of the shock wave. The peak gradually loses amplitude as the wave travels due to the points behind the peak moving with lower speed than the peak it self.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case with $A=-0.02$, the step function takes on a \"negative\" shape, and so the sides move with a higher speed than the points inside the step. As such the shock wave develops on the left side of the step, where the sides catches up with the slower moving points inside the step. As the amplitude of the initial step function is lower in this case than the previous, we don't see the same amount of \"dampening\" of the peak of the shock wave over the same amount of time. I think this is due to the reduced amplitude difference between either side of the discontinuity and that the width of the step is the same in both cases, but the amplitude is much lower in the second case."

    "In the numerical solution, we see the initial condition patently evolving into something that looks like a discontinuity. We understand that this discontinuity is formed because the characteristic curves $dx_p/dt = a(x, t, u) = u$ are more inclined (i.e., faster) in a spacetime diagram when starting at elements with larger $u$: since the solution is constant along those curves, the faster elements, therefore, catch those in front of them which have lower $u$ (as is the case in the solution you have found numerically here) – so the solution must steepen when that happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically and physically, we should not be too surprised: we know that, for instance, in gas dynamics, weird nonlinear phenomena take place, some of which (the shocks) have to do with the formation of discontinuities or sharp transitions. Numerically, though, we ought to be rather surprised for various reasons:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a. the numerical calculation of a very large value of the derivative (as is surely the case across the big jump forming in our calculation) cannot be very accurate. It might even happen, we think, that the program crashed because of _NaNs_ or exceptions, etc, occurring in the calculation. But, in fact, our program happily calculates away ... seemingly forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. when a discontinuity forms, the exact mathematical solution, strictly speaking, cannot be calculated in a simple way anymore: when there is a discontinuity, one must take into account what is called the jump relations, also called internal boundary conditions, across the discontinuity: they give the mutual relation of the variables on either side of the discontinuity. A solution obtained in this way is called a __weak solution__ in mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. we finally ask ourselves what the mathematically-exact weak solution would be in this case and whether our simple numerical scheme provides a solution near the exact one despite the obvious difficulty of handling large jumps across the near-discontinuity.\n",

    "Im not sure if I understood this task correctly. I interpret it this way: Using the same setup as in ex_4a, compare the Lax method and the upwind method. This means using the `*_uadv` methods and the initial condition from ex_4a. At this point I must admit I'm a bit confused, as I've been doing both this task and the last task in ex_4a more or less at the same time, so I hope I'll be able to make my self clear in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "I've described the evolution of the Lax-method and what we expect previously and in ex_4a. Now compared to the Upwind method we see the two methods differ quite a lot, and I think this is due to the flux conservation as is kindly hinted to in the task. The Upwind method better resolves the very sharp edge formed by the discontinuity, where the Lax-method is more diffusive so the \"corners\" at the top and bottom of the shock is more curved or smooth. However, the Upwind method is not flux-conservative. As the faster moving points (starting inside the step) catch up to the slower moving points the amplitude of the traveling wave dies out as the shock wave front is not moving. The Lax-method solution on the other hand gets more and more elongated as the shock wave front travels, and the peak of the edge is not as dampened. I think this is because the Lax-method is more flux-conservative. If this was for example a wave in some incompressible fluid, the Upwind method does not conserve the mass or energy of the traversing wave, while the Lax-method seems to (at least) conserve the mass. I've tested this by simply integrating the curve over space for each time step below. As we can see, the area under the curve is constant for the Lax-method, analogous to conserving mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess this is an example of the types of dilemmas we are faced with when trying to solve different types of physicals problems, there exist no perfect method for all types of problems. While the Upwind method is very stable and non-diffusive, it is not conservative - while the Lax-method is more conservative, albeit highly diffusive."

    "In the above plot I integrate over space in each time step, but excluding the first index of the spacial domain. This is due to hwo the periodic boundary conditions are implemented. As we are imposing `uu[0] == uu[nump-2]` and `uu[nump-1] == uu[1]`, we have a duplicate point which sticks out when the shock wave front is right at the boundary between the left and right edge of the plot. This would not have been a problem if I also followed the other point hinted to previously, such that the left hand of the spacial domain `x=x0` coincides with `x[1]`, but I'm not sure how to implement this precisely. I think that with this hint we are including a \"ghost\" point in the left side of the domain so that the periodic boundaries is better behaved. The way I have implemented it I in a way included the ghost point as the start of my domain. I'll look into this more."
