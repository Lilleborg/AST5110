The orange curve displays this solution, and we see it shifted along the x-axis to the left as expected with `a=-1`. Here I also continued the evolution of 30 more time steps, to have the solution travel beyond the end of the interval to see what happens. Of course we loose sight of the \"wave\" as it travels beyond `x_0`, but we can also see some residual effect on the right of the interval which I expect is due to the last ill calculated grid point that comes from using the downwind method."

    "Here I've developed the `evolve_adv_burgers` method in `nm_lib`, evolving the burgers equation `nt=200` steps forward in time. The evolve method takes in the same type of parameter `bnd_limits` and `bnd_type` which is passed through to the `step_adv_burgers` method. As far as I've understood (and tested) the periodicity of the problem is dealt with solely in the part of the evolution which is calculating the time step (the output of `step_adv_burgers`), which translates the periodic boundaries into the solution at the next time step, so with this approach I don't have to pad the actual solution `u_j^n+1`. I hope this is still the case for more complex problems, e.i. for non-uniform advection speeds. I guess I'll find out in the next exercises, but also appreciate any pointers/feedback on this way of dealing with the boundaries.\n",

Here it is very easy to see the smearing effect I discussed in the previous task when we compare the solution to the exact one. Here I've actually widened the upper boundary for the x-interval to demonstrate the solution on an antisymmetric grid, which means I've even poorer resolution in space as we can see from the discretization of the curves.\n",

I refer to that notebook for a slightly more in depth analysis, but the main take away is that the shape of the solution stays constant in time, but moving in the direction of the sign of `a` with a constant speed (as long as `a` is a constant). The smearing is evident near the peaks and troughs, and so a good first test of the solution would be the maximum absolute value between the exact and the numerical solution."

    "Here I loop over a few different resolutions in space, and evaluate the maximum absolute error between the exact and the numerical solution at a desired time. The solution moves with the constant speed `a=-1`, and with an interval of length $5.2$ that should mean the function moves once through the domain in $\\Delta t = 5.2$. I chose `time_check=52`, where each solution has passed through the interval 10 times. I think this is an effective test, and we can see the solution approaching the exact solution more and more for increased number of intervals in space. At `nint=1024` the max error is below $10\\%$. I will try to implement this test as a CI/CD pipeline, in `test_ex_2b.py` from the `nm_lib` library.\n",
