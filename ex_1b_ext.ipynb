    "In my implementation of `nm_lib.order_conv` I've just used the base 2 logarithm instead of the natural, and sliced every 4th and 2nd element for `hh4` and `hh2` to get it on the same shape as `hh`. Here I've made a script testing the implementation on the 4th order and central differentiation schemes. I expected to get an array with values close to four and two for the two respective cases, but instead I get negative values. Im not sure why this is the case, but I suspect it may be caused by the slicing. Numerically it makes sense, as we take the log of a small value, but from the derivation of Eq. 4 I expected it to be positiv.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">GREAT JOB! What I like about this method is that it also shows the spatial error. Great that you realized that you have to remove n number of the points at the boundaries depending on the method. If I'm not mistaken the -2 is because it comes from $1/dx^2$. Does it make sense to you? </span>.\n"
